# matlab-filtering
Weighted mean and median filtering on standard grey-scale images using MATLAB. 
Noise is added to the initial clean images : Gaussian and Salt & Pepper. 
Then using Weighted mean and median filtering algorithms on MATLAB, these images are denoised.
The output is the PSNR ratio of the original to the denoised image.
